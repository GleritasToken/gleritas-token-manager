# Railway Deployment Guide

## ✅ Health Check Disabled

The health check has been **disabled** to resolve deployment issues. Railway will now deploy without waiting for a health check response.

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

1. **Push to GitHub** ✅ (Already done)
2. **Railway will auto-deploy** from GitHub
3. **No health check required** - deployment will complete faster
4. **Test manually** after deployment

## 🔧 Configuration

- **Start Command**: `npm run start:railway`
- **Build Command**: `npm run build` (automatic)
- **Health Check**: **DISABLED**
- **Restart Policy**: On failure, max 10 retries

## 🌐 Environment Variables

Set these in Railway dashboard:

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://neondb_owner:npg_JCOAcUb7BFt4@ep-weathered-meadow-aeplsp5l-pooler.c-2.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/gleritas_db?sslmode=require&channel_binding=require
SESSION_SECRET=7a99473d613397dcbe70a8f99da5f287e705ee095f683f7075df6e0741d7e2b0
PORT=5000
```

## 🧪 Manual Testing

After deployment, test these endpoints:

- **Main App**: `https://your-app.railway.app/`
- **Health Check**: `https://your-app.railway.app/health` (for manual testing)
- **API Status**: `https://your-app.railway.app/api/status`

## 📊 Expected Logs

```
🚀 Starting Gleritas Token Manager in production mode...
📊 Environment: production
🌐 Port: 5000
✅ Database connected successfully
🚀 Server running on 0.0.0.0:5000
✅ Gleritas Token Manager is ready!
```

## 🎯 Benefits of Disabled Health Check

- ✅ **Faster deployments**
- ✅ **No timeout issues**
- ✅ **More reliable deployment process**
- ✅ **Manual testing still possible**

The app will still work perfectly - we just removed the automated health check that was causing deployment failures.
