I can't find referral code on the referral page, work on that by making sure a unique code is generated for a user at which they can refer their friends

After that, let's create the admin page from where the admins can manage (add, edit, remove) tasks, users and literally everything on the page set Admin Username = Gleritastoken@gmail.com
aet Admin Password = Gtoken234@@
