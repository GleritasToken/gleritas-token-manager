I love what i'm seeing, now let's allow this to be able to switch between light and dark mode

the wallet connect button should have manual connect so it can allow connecting to users wallet apps

on the withdrawal page, 
Important Notice:

*The withdrawal system is currently locked till airdrop ends. We are working on implementing a secure token distribution mechanism. Once ready, you'll be able to withdraw GLRS tokens directly to your connected wallet.* this is what I want written there and also remove the pay bnb fee from there

on the about page, remove the *how it works tab*, change the header *resources* to *to learn more about gleritas*

and change the about should be *Gleritas (GLRS) is a next-generation blockchain-powered cryptocurrency
built to seamlessly connect the world of digital assets with the fast-growing
e-commerce industry. Our mission is to empower both merchants and
consumers by providing fast, secure, and cost-effective payment solutions
that goes beyond traditional systems.*

and add tokenomics the about page and you can also make it look nice in like a 3d graphical way
Tokenomics:
Total Supply: 1,000,000,000 Tokens
Pre-Sale: 25%
Liquidity & Exchanges: 20%
Staking and Rewards: 20%
Development & Marketing: 20%
Airdrop Campaign: 5%
Team & Advisors: 10%

Now, let create a cool crypto landing page for the project that will depict a crypto system for e-commerce use and will have the login and sign-up toggle  

Sign up page should include where users can add referral codes and code owners get awarded 250 points per referrals 

after each successful sign-up there should be an animated pop-up saying *Registration Successful, Welcome to Gleritas* and they automatically get directed to users homepage and get awarded 500 points for registration

Homepage shows pop-up requiring users manually connects their BSC wallets (they won't be able to access any task if wallet not connected). After connecting Wallet, a *Wallet successfully connected* message pops up and disappears. Users gets awarded 100 points for wallet connect

let's edit the tasks page. clear all existing tasks and create new tasks in the following order 
1. Referral Task (Users must refer at least 3 users) this task earns them 500 points on completion
2. Join Telegram Group Task
3. Join Telegram Channel Task
4. Follow Twitter Page Task
5. Subscribe to Youtube Channel Task
6. Like Youtube Video Task
